# The Drone Assisted Vehicle Routing Problem with Robot Stations and Time Windows Instances
A repository with instances for the VRPD-RS-TW

The VRPD with Robot Stations and Time Windows (or VRPD-RS-TW) is an extension of the Travelling Salesman Problem with Drone (TSP-D), where a fleet of trucks served each by a single drone should work in collaboration to serve customers with their corresponding parcels. In the VRPD-RS-TW trucks are allowed to visit robots stations that can dispatch autonomous robots to deliver parcels. In this regard, the VRPD-RS-TW is a transportation problem focused on the last-mile delivery operations, where autonomous vehicles, such as drones and robots are involved in the delivery process and together should minimize operational costs while meeting time windows constraints.

Comments within an instance's file start with /* and end with */ and have to be ignored by a parser.
